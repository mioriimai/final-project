# ðŸ‘—Wearly
A full-stack web application for people who want to organize fashion items and save outfits digitally.

## Why I Built This

Since sometimes I waste my time by taking out all my clothes to decide what I'm going to wear on the day and putting them back in my closet in the morning, I wanted to build an application where I could see fashion items I have from my device and also record my favorite outfits.
